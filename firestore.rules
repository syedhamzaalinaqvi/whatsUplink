/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset defaults to locked-down access. All reads and writes are explicitly denied unless
 *                  allowed by a specific rule.  Since no data entities or structure are defined in the input,
 *                  the ruleset provides a basic template that prevents all access.
 * @data_structure No data structure has been defined.
 * @key_security_decisions All access is denied by default due to the lack of defined entities.
